# 🏈 Football Player Performance Classification

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying football players based on performance or quality metrics using machine learning models. By leveraging a dataset containing various player statistics, the project builds models to predict player classes (e.g., elite vs average) through thorough data exploration, preprocessing, and classification.
