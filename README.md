# 🍎 Apple Quality Classification

## 🧠 Project Overview

This machine learning project aims to classify the **quality of apples** (good or bad) based on various physicochemical attributes such as size, weight, sugar content, acidity, etc. Using supervised learning techniques, the model can assist in automating fruit quality control for agriculture and supply chain systems.
